        <h3>Summary/Grading:</h3>
        <p>
            Ask not where I used bootstrap, ask, where did I not use bootstrap. The answer is that question is the
            page you're looking at right now, but every other page currently accessible through the app is certainly
            bootstrap-ified.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Glyphicons, you can find them in the nav and the alerts.
            </li>
            <li>
                Input groups, you can find them on the complete student registration
                page.
            </li>
            <li>
                Nav, my nav is a fixed to the top bootstrap-themed nav.
            </li>
            <li>
                Labels, used in displaying the student profile and other places.
            </li>
            <li>
                Page header, used as the header for most pages.
            </li>
            <li>
                Alerts, used in various places when forms are submitted.
            </li>
            <li>
                List groups, used in displaying student profile info.
            </li>
            <li>
                Panels, used to display chunks of information, most notably, I have
                nested panels in the DGS overview.
            </li>
            <li>
                Input group addon, used to prepend the u in front of a unid during student
                registration.
            </li>
            <li>
                Forms, all of my forms use form-horizontal which treats form-groups
                as rows.
            </li>
            <li>
                Extensive use of the grid system to organize chunks of information in a responsive manner,
                all pages are mobile friendly.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>UI Choice:</h3>
        <p>
            I took out my css everywhere but the readme, because I feel like this page really isn't a part of the
            application. I made heavey use of panels, the grid system, and other bootstrap components to organize information.
